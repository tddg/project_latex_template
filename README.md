# Template of DS5110/CS5501 Project Report


[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a software system for
document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as
opposed to the formatted text found in
[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) (what you see is
what you get) word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Doc.

For Checkpoint #2 report, you may comment out `\input{metadata}` in
`paper.tex` as `metadata.tex` will only be used for the final report. 

The repo includes a makefile so you can directly `make` the PDF
locally if your computer has latex installed.. 

More conveniently, you could use hosted Latex service such as
Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) for collaborative latex editing
with your teammates.
